# Next-Plan

In this project, I created a work schedule calendar, that allows users to keep track of their daily habits and/or to-do list tasks. The schedule will operate based on timings of the day to showcase whether a task is in the past, present or future.

## User-Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

```
